            <p>Making the most of a modest budget, the S.C.A.M. banking website was created through
                hard work, blood, sweat and tears. Using a combination of HTML and CSS, the website
                was made to encompass the mission of client. A grid system was used to organize the
                site while providing the viewer with a mixture of images and information
                to allow them to best understand and engage with what they were looking at.
            </p><br><br>

            <p>Due to the limited budget, many of the images had to be outsourced to small local company, Google.
