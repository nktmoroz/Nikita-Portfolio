            <p>Making the most of a modest budget, the S.C.A.M. banking website was created through
                hard work, blood, sweat and tears. Using a combination of HTML and CSS, the website
                was made to encompass the mission of client. A grid system was used to organize the
                site while providing the viewer with a mixture of images and information
                to allow them to best understand and engage with what they were looking at.
            </p><br><br>

            <p>Due to the limited budget, many of the images had to be outsourced to small local company, Google.

            <p>Using simple HTML and CSS I created a page for my hometown of Sammamish Washginton.
                I was able to get all of the information I needed from a quick google search
                including the information I needed for the table at the bottom. This page wasn't
                nearly as nice as somme of the older ones but still utilized paragraphs and titles
                as well as tables for presenting information.

            <p>To the left you can see a screenshot of the page. While a bit barren on the color scheme, 
                all of the necessary organizational tools are in full use with a bit of scenic imagery.

            <p>
                Using scripting in C# on the popular game engine, Unity, I created a simple test game.
                At the moment, an spawner object creates enemies that appear in the middle of the screen
                and their health is displayed above them. Pressing the button will attack the enemy
                using your character's stored attack value (in this case 1). After each enemy dies a new one
                is spawned in by the spawner. Currently the enemies do not attack but a player health number
                is shown. The project is currently on hiatus but could the seeds for another new project.
